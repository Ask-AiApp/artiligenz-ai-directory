How to test with 100 nodes (Generator)

In index.html, make sure this line is uncommented:

<script src="data/generator.js" defer></script>


In scripts.js, flip the flags at the top of “Data source”:

const USE_GENERATOR = true;
const GENERATOR_N = 100; // try 70, 100, then 150 if you like


Reload the page.

That’s it—the app will render a synthetic directory of N companies with realistic categories/statuses, so you can exercise:

N→template mapping (31–80 → three bands; 81+ → fibonacci)

smartFit + zoom clamp after every sidebar change

LOD behavior (labels/edges) as you zoom

What to look for (quick checklist)

Lands centered, reasonable zoom after each filter/search change.

No label crowding at far zoom; labels appear crisply ~0.6+ zoom.

Edges thin/hide appropriately as you zoom out.

Drawer interaction stays flicker-free with rapid node clicks.

If you want to try your 500 later

Totally doable. We’ll:

keep fibonacci for 81+,

tighten smartPaddingForN a notch,

be a bit more aggressive on edge LOD (hide low-weight edges earlier).
No architecture changes needed.

Give 100 a spin; if anything feels off at that scale, we’ll tune the template thresholds/padding next.
